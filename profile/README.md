# Bitcoin Burials

Bitcoin Burials is a 10k Ordinals collection of lovingly crafted headstones in a pixel art style each engraved with the BTC logo and a date tied to an Obituary predicting Bitcoin's death as selected from an historic archive. Making Bitcoin magical again one Burial at a time.

Our aim is to help improve the Ordinal landscape through open source software tooling and greater solutions to decentralisation. You can read more about how we achieve the latter [here](https://bitcoinburials.substack.com/p/funeralfriday-is-upon-us)
